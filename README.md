Hello world! Welcome to my awesome project

Data set of marks secured by students in various subjects. Downloaded from kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

Data is generated randomly from
http://roycekimmons.com/tools/generated_data/exams

To Do:

* Do README
* Fix up correlation map (palette and data)
* Do more correlations between predictors and responses
* Learn more about factorial ANOVA to find meaningful predictors (this is because all categorical)
